Generalised Reinforcement Learning Fuzzy Logic Controller with Vague States (GRLFC)

This repository is created to provide the code for GRLFC. The fuzzy logic controller utilises reinfocement learning to tune the output labels of the Actor and the Critic in interaction with its environment. The fuzzy logic controller accepts vague sensor readings, and is coded following an object-oriented approach. The code is implemented to control the inverted pendulum for which the dynamics equations are also coded and provided; however, you can use the convenience of utilising the objects to create the fuzzy logic controller of your choice. The results of implementing the code are published in the following paper.
